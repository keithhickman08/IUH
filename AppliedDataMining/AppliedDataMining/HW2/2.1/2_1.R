## Problem Set 2.1

## Problem 1.  
## For the following data, give the best taxonomic type (interval, ratio, nominal, ordinal):

##  1. A section of highway on a map. Interval
##  2. The value of a stock. Ratio
##  3. The weight of a person. Ratio, as we can be infinitely precise
##  4. Marital status. Ordinal. (One would have to be single before married, married before divorced. Thus
##    there is some implicit ordering among the variable.
##  5. Visiting United Airlines (https://www.united.com) the seating is: Economony, Economy plus,
##    and United Business. Ordinal.

## Problem 2.  It depends on the domain or problem set. Am I dealing with a real estate sales, school enrollment, crime stats, or other type
## of question. I might need additional data such as latitude/longitude (map), home details (real estate), assigned schools, and
## other neighborhood info.
